A 2D Platformer where you play an autistic girl navigating her disability while trying to get home.  
  
The game is currently in alpha.  
The main branch consists of the latest progress of the game.  

The prototyping branch consists of:  
- the platform: testing platforming mechanics  
- the npc: testing NPC dialogue interaction mechanics  
- the distress: testing damage and health restoration mechanics  
- MVP: combining the platform, the npc, and the distress, and adding win/lose conditions, secondary stress bar that does damage, and movement changes relating to distress. This is considered the Minimum Viable Prototype/Product.  
- Art Prototyping: early concept art and work on player character design
