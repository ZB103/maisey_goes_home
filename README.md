Platform Spectrum (working title) is a 2D platformer in which you play an autistic protagonist. You must navigate the social, sensory, and attention challenges as you hop across platforms, escape from enemies, and work toward your goal of finding the Super Special Thing.  
  
The game is currently in early pre-alpha.  
Three small test games have been made to expand on the core features of the game.  
- the platform  
- the npc  
- the distress  
  
Please feel free to try them out, and I hope they made you excited for the full game!
